The provided solution is a workaround, since the root cause might be within Expo CLI itself or external factors. Consider these steps:

1. **Clean the project:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any cached build artifacts.  
2. **Update dependencies:** Ensure all your project dependencies are updated using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. 
3. **Restart your machine:**  Sometimes a simple reboot solves temporary problems related to caching.
4. **Check Network:** Ensure your network connection is stable and allows for outbound connections to the needed services.
5. **Check the Expo documentation:** The Expo website might offer more insights into resolving build issues.
6. **Test on a different machine/environment:** If the problem is persistent, try building the project on a different machine or environment to eliminate machine-specific factors.

If none of the above solutions work, a more in-depth analysis of the error logs might be needed. Consider reaching out to the Expo community or searching for similar issues in their forums or issue tracker.
