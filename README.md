# Intermittent Expo CLI Build Failure

This repository demonstrates an intermittent build failure issue with the Expo CLI.  The issue is characterized by a lack of clear error messages, making debugging difficult. The build process sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails without any apparent code changes. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe that the build process may succeed or fail inconsistently.

## Potential Causes

* **Caching issues:** Expo CLI may be caching incorrect or outdated build artifacts.
* **Network connectivity:** Intermittent network issues might disrupt the build process.
* **Third-party library conflicts:** Conflicts or bugs in external libraries might be causing the failure.
* **Expo CLI bug:**  It is possible this is a bug within the Expo CLI itself. 

## Workarounds

* **Clear the cache:** Try clearing the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`. 
* **Restart the machine:** A simple restart might resolve temporary issues.
* **Check network stability:** Ensure a stable network connection during the build process.
* **Update dependencies:** Update all project dependencies to the latest versions. 
* **Check for library conflicts:** Review third-party libraries for known issues or compatibility problems.
